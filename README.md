# MediaShare
I created this based on the WebShare repo that I published earlier.
At the moment it only shares images, but as the name suggests I would also like to extend this in the future to include other items of media.

To run, execute the following command:
`python mshare.py [path to rooot of images]`
There are some optional arguments as well:
- tempdir : directory that you want to store the thumbnail versions of your images
- port    : TCP port that you would like your webserver to listen on.
- host    : IP address that you would like your webserver to bind to.

Please feel free to use as you see fit.
